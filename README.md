Hello! I'm Axorax. I like to make websites, YouTube videos, games, music and more!
I enjoy studying science, programming and playing chess. I always appreciate feedback whether it is good or bad!

I am currently a student. I try my best to study and make content alongside.
My favorite subjects are Physics, Biology, Mathematics, Chemistry and English.
My dream is to become a doctor and a professional programmer. ðŸ˜Ž
